# Create some code to randomly select a number under 10
# The user must try to guess this number in 3 or less guesses
# If the users guess is too low, tell them
# If the users guess is too high, tell them
# There is a strategy to this game which will allow you to always win. Figure out that strategy

/* Example
computer chooses 3
3 guesses remaining
user guesses 1
"too low"
2 guesses remaining
user guesses 9
"too high"
1 guess remaining
user guesses 3
"Correct"
